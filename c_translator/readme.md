C translator

The grammar used in parser is mainly based on Yacc grammar written by Jeff Lee for ANSI C.

Many of the test cases in "final" folder are from one of the previous year's repo: https://github.com/fexter-svk/C90Compiler-EIE2/tree/master/test

Although it has a makefile and bash for testing itself, they are edited to merge with c_compiler. Therefore this testing bash is not runnable in final version.
